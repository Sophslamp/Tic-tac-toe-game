# Tic-tac-toe-game
This is a Python program that allows two users to play a game of Tic-tac-toe in the command line.

How to play
1. Run the tic_tac_toe.py file in your terminal using the following command: python tic_tac_toe.py
2. The program will display an empty Tic-tac-toe board and prompt the first player (X) to make their move.
3. To make a move, enter a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the cell you want to place your X or O in (see the board layout below).
4. The program will then display the updated board and prompt the next player to make their move.
5. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
